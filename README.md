# Test project for DM linker

This is a sandbox for testing out Yarn and its integration with DM language and [DMPM](https://github.com/dmpm-team).

To use yarn, you need:

- Node 12.22.3 or later
- Yarn 1.22.10 or later (optional)

In case if you don't want to install Yarn, you can use the provided shell script `bin/yarn` instead of just `yarn`.

## How to test

```
yarn install
```

Then create a DME file and feel free to experiment!

## Structure

First of all, this project has a `/packages` folder, which is a Yarn workspace. Each package here is automatically linked, and this is perfect for developing packages that are *local* to the DM project.

There is also a `/vendor` folder, which is automatically generated every time you run `yarn install`. Here is the basic structure of that folder:

```
/vendor
  /package1-9fe34d -- Third party packages
  /package2-7bca29
  /includes.dm      -- List of includes generated by DM linker.
  /pathmap.json    -- A cached version of all package resolutions.
                      (might not be necessary in the future)
```

These third party packages are downloaded based on `dependencies` specified in packages in the `/packages` folder and extracted into `/vendor` with a suffixed checksum of the package.

As a developer, you only need to include `/vendor/includes.dm` into your DME file, which contains all resolutions generated (and topologically sorted) by the DM linker plugin for Yarn.
